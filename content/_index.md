# Benjamin Chiong
Hello! I'm a developer who likes to create web stuff that are engaging, thoughtful, and accessible. I was born in the same year as the World Wide Web was invented, which probably explains my affinity to web technologies. But more than that, I like everything web because of its very principle of openness and democracy.
